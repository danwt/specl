module KaspaBridge

// Kaspa-Hub lock-and-mint bridge with anchor-UTXO-chain mechanism.
// Based on the protocol described in kaspa.txt.
//
// Actors:
//   Relayer (untrusted): observes chains, requests signatures, relays messages
//   Validator (trusted, stateless): verifies chain state, signs withdrawals
//
// Safety mechanisms:
//   Withdrawals: UTXO-uniqueness on Kaspa + compare-and-set on Hub
//   Deposits: outpoint seen-set anti-replay on Hub
//
// Messages are unordered (modeled as sets) and lossy (drop actions).
// Signed withdrawals persist: the relayer always has the signed data and
// can attempt replay. Kaspa UTXO rules are the sole replay prevention.
// Executed withdrawals persist: they are on-chain on Kaspa. Hub
// compare-and-set is the sole mechanism preventing re-confirmation.
//
// Quick:     specl check kaspa.specl -c N=3 --no-deadlock --bfs --no-auto
// Strenuous: specl check kaspa.specl -c N=5 --no-deadlock --bfs --no-auto --fast
