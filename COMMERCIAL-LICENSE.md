# Commercial License

Specl is dual-licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE) (AGPL-3.0) and a commercial license.

## Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)

You may use, modify, and distribute Specl under the terms of the AGPL-3.0. This requires that any derivative work or service built on Specl also be released under the AGPL-3.0 with full source code.

## Commercial License

If the AGPL-3.0 does not meet your needs — for example, if you want to:

- Use Specl in proprietary software without releasing your source code
- Integrate Specl into a commercial product or SaaS offering
- Avoid the copyleft obligations of the AGPL

Then you need a commercial license.
